Step 1: Launch 5 ubuntu 18.04 servers in AWS

Step2: Add the Same User in all ubuntu servers
          1) Add User "teja" and then enter & retype the new unix password for that user
                   $ sudo adduser teja
                       Enter new UNIX password:teja
                       Retype new UNIX password:teja

         2) Switch to root 
                  $ sudo -i

         3) Give sudo permissions to that user so that they can execute any command
                  # visudo
                  -----> Add this line {  teja  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL  }

         4) Go to sshd_config file and change PasswordAuthentication as "yes"
                  # nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
                  -----> change PasswordAuthentication as yes

         5) Restart ssh service
                  # service ssh restart

         6) To access user "teja", type the below command
                  # ssh teja@localhost

         7) It will display like below after getting into user "teja" mode
                 teja@ip-172-31-34-193:~$ 

Step 3: Give hostnames to 5 ubuntu servers such as
                 # hostname first-server
                 # hostname second-server
                 # hostname third-server
                 # hostname fourth-server
                 # hostname fifth-server

Step 4: Generate key in the first-server and then copy that key to all other servers. So that it will not ask for password while access the user.

      1) To access user "teja", type below command
                # su - teja

      2) Generate key
               $ ssh-keygen

      3) Copy key to all other 4 ubuntu servers by using the following command...
               $ ssh-copy-id teja@ip-172-31-35-39.us-east-2.compute.internal

      4) To access the user of one server to another server without using host name....
               $ ssh ip-172-31-35-39.us-east-2.compute.internal 

      5) To access the user of one server to another server by using host name ....

              a) Add ipaddresses and hostnames of all servers in /etc/hosts

              b) To access the user in another server....
                   $ ssh second-server
                          (or)
                   $ ssh third-server
